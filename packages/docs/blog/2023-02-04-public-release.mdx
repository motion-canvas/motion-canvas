After months of work, I'm happy to announce that Motion Canvas is ready for the
public release!

<YouTubeVideo src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H5GETOP7ivs" />

Don't get me wrong - the road ahead is still long. Plenty of features left to
implement and tons of bugs to find and fix. But the foundations are here. Motion
Canvas helped me make most of my videos last year, and I'm positive some of you
will find it helpful as well.

Head to the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart) guide and give it a try.
