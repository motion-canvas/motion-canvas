# Project variables

Making animations dynamic can be achieved using project variables. These could
be used for light/dark themes, changing Node styling or editing text content.
Project variables make use of signals - allowing variables to be updated during
animations.

Adding variables via the player component can be done by passing a stringified
json object to the variables attribute:

```html
<motion-canvas-player
  src="/path/to/project.js"
  variables='{"circleFill":"red"}'
></motion-canvas-player>
```

They can also be added using makeProject():

```ts
export default makeProject({
  scenes: [example],
  variables: {circleFill: 'red'},
});
```

Accessing the variables inside of a scene is through
[`useScene()`](/api/core/utils#useScene):

```ts
const circleFill = useScene().variables.get('circleFill', 'blue');
```
