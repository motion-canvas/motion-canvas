# Spawners

Sometimes we want the children of a given node to be reactive. In other words,
we want them to change according to some external state. Consider the following
example:

```tsx
const count = createSignal(10);

view.add(
  <Layout layout>
    {range(count()).map(() => (
      <Circle width={32} height={32} fill={'white'} />
    ))}
  </Layout>,
);
```

We first create the `count` signal and then use its value to generate N number
of circles.

This example is not reactive - changing the `count` signal won't change the
number of circles inside the `Layout` node. We can fix that with the use of the
[`spawner`](/api/2d/components/NodeProps#spawner) property:

```tsx
const count = createSignal(10);

view.add(
  <Layout
    layout
    spawner={() =>
      range(count()).map(() => <Circle width={32} height={32} fill={'white'} />)
    }
  />,
);
```

`spawner` accepts a function that returns an array of nodes. These nodes will
become the new children of the `Layout` node. We can now animate our `count`
signal to check if it works:

```ts
yield * count(5, 2);
```

It's important to remember that (like most Node properties) `spawner` is a
signal. The function we pass to it will be invoked each time any of its
dependencies change. If the spawner happens to generate a large number of nodes
and its dependencies change every frame, it may drastically reduce the
playback's performance. To counteract this, we can use an object pool that will
let us reuse the same nodes instead of recreating them each time:

```tsx
const count = createSignal(10);

const pool = range(64).map(i => (
  <Circle x={i * 32} width={32} height={32} fill={'lightseagreen'} />
));

const layout = createRef<Layout>();
view.add(<Layout layout ref={layout} spawner={() => pool.slice(0, count())} />);
```

Apart from the spawner function, the pool should never be accessed directly. Use
the `children()` signal of the parent object to get references to the spawned
objects:

```tsx
// ... continuing from above ...
let spawnedCircles = layout().children() as Circle[];
yield *
  all(
    ...spawnedCircles.map(function* (circle) {
      yield* circle.scale(1.5, 1).to(1, 1);
    }),
  );
```

Be aware that the references returned by a call to `children()` may be
invalidated when the number of spawned objects changes, and accessing the
invalidated objects may cause undefined behavior. Try not to save references to
spawned objects for too long, and use `children()` wherever possible to get the
updated list of spawned objects.
