# Editor

Editor plugins are an extension of runtime plugins that include additional hooks
for extending the editor interface itself.

<ExperimentalWarning />

Let's update our plugin's entry point to export an editor plugin. The main
difference is that we're now using the `makeEditorPlugin` function imported from
`@motion-canvas/ui` to define it:

```ts title="src/plugin.ts"
import {makeEditorPlugin} from '@motion-canvas/ui';
import {CustomTabConfig} from './CustomTabConfig';

export default makeEditorPlugin({
  name: 'editor-test',
  tabs: [CustomTabConfig],
});
```

This gives us access to some additional hooks that we can use to extend the
interface. In the example above, we use `tabs` to declare an array of custom
tabs that will be added to the left sidebar.

The tab configuration is imported from a new file called `CustomTabConfig.tsx`
that we have yet to create. Let's take a look at how it may look like:

```tsx title="src/CustomTabConfig.tsx"
/* @jsxImportSource preact */

import {
  Pane,
  PhotoCamera,
  PluginTabConfig,
  PluginTabProps,
  Separator,
  Tab,
} from '@motion-canvas/ui';

function TabComponent({tab}: PluginTabProps) {
  return (
    <Tab title="My Tab" id="custom-tab" tab={tab}>
      <PhotoCamera />
    </Tab>
  );
}

function PaneComponent() {
  return (
    <Pane title="My Pane" id="custom-pane">
      <Separator size={1} />
      Hello <strong>World</strong>!
    </Pane>
  );
}

export const CustomTabConfig: PluginTabConfig = {
  name: 'inspector',
  tabComponent: TabComponent,
  paneComponent: PaneComponent,
};
```

First of all, the editor is built on top of [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).
Just like Motion Canvas, Preact uses JSX to define components. This means that
in `tsx` files extending the editor, we need to let TypeScript know that it
should import the `jsx` factory function from `preact` and not
`@motion-canvas/2d`. This can be done in multiple different ways. In this simple
example, we'll just use a comment at the top of the file:

```tsx
/* @jsxImportSource preact */
```

Next, we define a component for the tab itself. This component will be rendered
in the navigation bar on the left. We use the `Tab` component from
`@motion-canvas/ui` to stay consistent with the rest of the editor. We also
borrow the `PhotoCamera` icon and put it inside:

```tsx
function TabComponent({tab}: PluginTabProps) {
  return (
    <Tab title="My Tab" id="custom-tab" tab={tab}>
      <PhotoCamera />
    </Tab>
  );
}
```

Similarly, we define a component for the pane that will be rendered when the tab
is selected:

```tsx
function PaneComponent() {
  return (
    <Pane title="My Pane" id="custom-pane">
      <Separator size={1} />
      Hello <strong>World</strong>!
    </Pane>
  );
}
```

Lastly, we export the configuration object:

```tsx
export const CustomTabConfig: PluginTabConfig = {
  name: 'inspector',
  tabComponent: TabComponent,
  paneComponent: PaneComponent,
};
```

Editor plugins are still experimental and the API is not yet properly documented
but if you want to play around with some other available hooks you can take a
look at [this editor plugin][example-plugin] provided by the `@motion-canvas/2d`
package. It's responsible for displaying the inspector tab and drawing an
overlay on top of the preview when clicking on different nodes.
