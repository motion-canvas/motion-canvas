# Authoring plugins

Plugins are a way to extend the functionality of Motion Canvas.

Motion Canvas consists of two parts running in separate environments: a
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development server running on Node.js and an editor
running in the browser. Browser-related code can be split further into two
parts:

- Runtime - all the logic necessary to play the animation, such as the `Player`
  instance, Scene definitions (including the actual source code of your
  animation), etc.
- Editor - the interface that lets you preview the animation, edit the settings,
  etc.

Depending on your needs, you can extend any of these parts with a plugin:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />

# Plugin examples

You can take a look at our [FFmpeg plugin][ffmpeg-plugin] for an example of a
fully-fledged plugin. It's runtime portion provides the editor with a Video
[exporter](/api/core/app/Exporter) that sends the rendered frames over to
Node.js. The server portion then uses FFmpeg to convert the frames into a video.
