# Experimental features

Motion Canvas follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme. Among
other things, this means that any release with the same major version will be
backwards compatible. For example, an animation made using `v3.2.0` (In this
case the major version is `3`) will work just fine with `v3.2.1`, `v3.3.0`,
`v3.4.0`, and so on.

Experimental features don't follow this rule. They are subject to change at any
time and may break your animations. They are meant to be used for testing and
feedback purposes only.

:::experimental

Throughout the documentation, experimental features are marked with a warning
like this one.

:::

In order to use experimental features, you need to enable them in your project
configuration:

```ts title="project.ts"
export default makeProject({
  // highlight-next-line
  experimentalFeatures: true,
  // ...
});
```
