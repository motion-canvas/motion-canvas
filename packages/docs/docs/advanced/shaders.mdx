# Shaders

Shaders allow you to apply custom effects to any node using WebGL.

<ExperimentalWarning />

Shaders can be specified using the [`shaders`](/api/2d/components/Node#shaders)
property. In the simplest case, the value should be a string containing the GLSL
code for the fragment shader:

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
import myShader from './myShader.glsl';

//...

view.add(
  <Circle
    size={200}
    fill="lightseagreen"
    // highlight-next-line
    shaders={myShader}
  />,
);
```

Below is an example of a simple shader that inverts the colors of the node:

```glsl title="myShader.glsl"
#version 300 es
precision highp float;

#include "@motion-canvas/core/shaders/common.glsl"

void main() {
    outColor = texture(sourceTexture, sourceUV);
    outColor.rgb = 1.0 - outColor.rgb;
}
```

## GLSL Preprocessor

Motion Canvas comes with a simple GLSL preprocessor that lets you include files
using the `#include` directive:

```glsl
#include "path-to-file"
```

The path is resolved using the same rules as `import` statements in JavaScript.
It can point to a relative file:

```glsl
#include "../utils/math.glsl"
```

Or to a file from another package:

```glsl
#include "@motion-canvas/core/shaders/common.glsl"
```

For convenience, a GLSL file can be imported only once per shader. Each
subsequent import of the same file will be ignored so `#ifdef` guards are not
necessary.

## Default uniforms

The following uniforms are available in all shaders:

```glsl
in vec2 screenUV;
in vec2 sourceUV;
in vec2 destinationUV;

out vec4 outColor;

uniform float time;
uniform float deltaTime;
uniform float framerate;
uniform int frame;
uniform vec2 resolution;
uniform sampler2D sourceTexture;
uniform sampler2D destinationTexture;
uniform mat4 sourceMatrix;
uniform mat4 destinationMatrix;
```

They can be included using the following directive:

```glsl
#include "@motion-canvas/core/shaders/common.glsl"
```

## Source and Destination

Shaders in Motion Canvas follow the same idea as
[`globalCompositeOperation`][globalCompositeOperation] in 2D canvas. The
`sourceTexture` contains the node being rendered, and the `destinationTexture`
contains what has already been rendered to the screen. These two can be sampled
using `sourceUV` and `destinationUV` respectively, and then combined in various
ways to produce the desired result.

## Custom uniforms

You can pass custom uniforms to the shader by replacing the shader string with a
configuration object:

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
import myShader from './myShader.glsl';

//...

view.add(
  <Circle
    size={200}
    fill="lightseagreen"
    // highlight-next-line
    shaders={{
      fragment: myShader,
      uniforms: {
        myFloat: 0.5,
        myVec2: new Vector2(2, 5),
        myColor: new Color('blue'),
      },
    }}
  />,
);
```

The `uniforms` property is an object where the keys are the names of the
uniforms and the values are what's passed to the shader.

The type of the uniform is inferred from the value:

| TypeScript                         | GLSL    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| `number`                           | `float` |
| `[number, number]`                 | `vec2`  |
| `[number, number, number]`         | `vec3`  |
| `[number, number, number, number]` | `vec4`  |
| [`Color`][Color]                   | `vec4`  |
| [`Vector2`][Vector2]               | `vec2`  |
| [`BBox`][BBox]                     | `vec4`  |
| [`Spacing`][Spacing]               | `vec4`  |

With that in mind, the uniforms from the above example will be available in the
shader as:

```glsl title="myShader.glsl"
uniform float myFloat;
uniform vec2 myVec2;
uniform vec4 myColor;
```

It's also possible to create custom classes that can be passed as uniforms by
implementing the [`WebGLConvertible`][WebGLConvertible] interface.

## Caching

When a node is cached, its contents are first rendered to a separate canvas and
then transferred to the screen (You can read more about it in the
[Filters and Effects](/docs/filters-and-effects#cached-nodes) section) When a
shader is applied to a descendant of a cached node, the `destinationTexture`
will only contain the things drawn in the context of that cached node and
nothing else. This is analogous to how composite operations work.

Any node with a shader is automatically cached - this lets us figure out the
contents of the `sourceTexture` before shaders are run. Caching requires us to
know the size and position of everything rendered by the node. This goes beyond
its logical size. Things like shadows, strokes, and filters can make the
rendered area larger. We account for that in the case of built-in effects, but
for custom shaders you may need to adjust the cache size manually. The
[`cachePadding`][cachePadding] property can be used to do exactly that. It
specifies the extra space around the node that should be included in the cache.

### View Caching

By default, the size of the cache is limited to the visible area. This may cause
certain shaders to behave incorrectly when the node is partially off-screen. To
fix this, you can increase the [`cachePadding`][cachePadding] of the view
itself. It will act as a buffer around the visible area.
