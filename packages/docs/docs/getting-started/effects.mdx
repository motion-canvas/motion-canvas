# Effects

Effects let you observe changes to signals and react to them. Unlike signals,
effects are not lazy:

- [`createEffect()`](/api/core/signals#createEffect) runs the callback
  immediately after any of its dependencies changes.
- [`createDeferredEffect()`](/api/core/signals#createDeferredEffect) runs the
  callback at the end of each frame during which any of its dependencies
  changed.

They are useful for side effects, such as modifying the node hierarchy or
spawning background animations in response to a change in some signals.

When it comes to modifying the properties of nodes, prefer to use
[signals](/docs/signals).

## Overview

Effects are created using the [`createEffect()`](/api/core/signals#createEffect)
and [`createDeferredEffect()`](/api/core/signals#createDeferredEffect)
functions. The first argument specifies the callback to invoke:

```ts
import {createSignal, createEffect} from '@motion-canvas/core';

const signal = createSignal(0);
createEffect(() => {
  console.log('Signal changed: ', signal());
});
```

After creation, effects can be disposed of using the returned function:

```ts
const unsubscribe = createEffect(() => {
  console.log('Signal changed: ', signal());
});

// do something

unsubscribe();
```

## Explanation

To understand the difference between signals and effects, consider this modified
example from the [signals](/docs/signals#explanation) section:

```ts
const radius = createSignal(1);
const area = createSignal(() => {
  console.log('area recalculated!');
  return Math.PI * radius() * radius();
});

createEffect(() => {
  area();
});
// area recalculated!

radius(2);
// area recalculated!
radius(3);
// area recalculated!
radius(4);
// area recalculated!
```

This time, the `area` signal is invoked inside an effect, instead of being
called directly. Now, whenever the `radius` signal changes, the effect is
triggered which recalculates the `area` signal instantly.

This is a compromise. On one hand, you can now react to changes immediately
without having to invoke the signal each frame. On the other hand, all
dependencies of the effect are no longer lazy. Normally this shouldn't be a
problem, but if the dependencies of the effect change often and are expensive to
calculate, this may affect seeking performance.

### Deferred effects

If your effect references multiple dependencies that change often, you can use
[`createDeferredEffect()`](/api/core/signals#createDeferredEffect) to defer them
until the end of the current frame. This way, the effect is only executed once,
even if multiple dependencies change. The downside is that the side effects
caused by the deferred effect are not immediately visible. They will become
visible after the current generator step is finished, but before the rendering
starts.

```ts
const a = createSignal(1);
const b = createSignal(2);

let value = 0;
createEffect(() => {
  console.log('effect invoked');
  value = a() + b();
});
// effect invoked

let deferredValue = 0;
createDeferredEffect(() => {
  console.log('deferred effect invoked');
  deferredValue = a() + b();
});
// deferred effect invoked

a(2);
// effect invoked
b(3);
// effect invoked

console.log(value); // 5 - effect's value is updated immediately.
console.log(deferredValue); // 3 - deferred effect's value is not yet ready.

yield; // deferred effect invoked
console.log(deferredValue); // 5
```

## Complex example

The following example demonstrates how to use effects to automatically update
the node hierarchy, so the amount of circles displayed matches the value of the
`count` signal:

```tsx editor
import {Circle, Layout, makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {
  createEffect,
  createRef,
  createSignal,
  spawn,
  waitFor,
} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const count = createSignal(0);
  const container = createRef<Layout>();

  view.add(<Layout alignItems={'center'} ref={container} layout />);

  const circles: Circle[] = [];
  createEffect(() => {
    const targetCount = Math.round(count());
    let i = circles.length;
    // add any missing circles
    for (; i < targetCount; i++) {
      const circle = (<Circle fill={'white'} />) as Circle;
      circles.push(circle);
      container().add(circle);
      spawn(circle.size(80, 0.3));
    }
    // remove any extra circles
    for (; i > targetCount; i--) {
      const circle = circles.pop()!;
      spawn(circle.size(0, 0.3).do(() => circle.remove()));
    }
  });

  count(1);
  yield* waitFor(1);
  count(6);
  yield* waitFor(1);
  count(4);
  yield* count(0, 2);
  yield* waitFor(1);
});
```
