# Presentation

Aside from exporting your animations, you can use Motion Canvas to present them
in real time. Simply define some slides in your animation and then navigate
between them using the Presentation Mode.

## `beginSlide` function

The [`beginSlide`](/api/core/utils#beginSlide) function is used to mark the
beginning of a new slide. When this function is yielded, the playback will pause
and wait for you to press `SPACE`:

```ts
import {makeScene2D, Txt} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {beginSlide, createRef, waitFor} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const title = createRef<Txt>();
  view.add(<Txt ref={title} />);

  title().text('FIRST SLIDE');
  yield* beginSlide('first slide');
  yield* waitFor(1); // try doing some actual animations here

  title().text('SECOND SLIDE');
  yield* beginSlide('second slide');
  yield* waitFor(1);

  title().text('LAST SLIDE');
  yield* beginSlide('last slide');
  yield* waitFor(1);
});
```

## Presentation Mode

To present your animation, navigate to the Video Settings <VideoSettings
  className="icon-inline"
  alt="Video Settings"
  title="Video Settings"
/> tab. Click on the dropdown next to the `RENDER` button and choose `PRESENT`.
From now on, pressing the button will enter the Presentation Mode (You can
switch back to rendering at any time using the same dropdown). Try entering the
Presentation Mode in <a href="/editor/presentation/" target="_blank">our online
editor</a>.

In this mode, you can quickly switch between all your slides using the panel on
the left. You can also use the playback controls at the bottom to navigate from
one slide to another. Hover over the buttons to see what they do and what
keyboard shortcuts are assigned to them. When switching to full screen, the
controls disappear, but you can still use your keyboard to navigate.
