# Signals

Signals represent a value that may change over time. They can be used to define
dependencies between the state of the animation. This way, when a value changes,
all other values that depend on it get automatically updated.

## Overview

Signals for primitive types are created using the
[`createSignal()`](/api/core/signals#createSignal) function, where the first
argument specifies their initial value:

```ts
import {createSignal} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/signals';

const signal = createSignal(0);
```

Additionally, each complex type has a static `createSignal()` method that can be
used to create a signal for said type:

```ts
import {Vector2} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/types';

const signal = Vector2.createSignal(Vector2.up);
```

Properties of every node are also represented by signals:

```tsx
const circle = <Circle />;

const signal = circle.fill;
```

Once created, signals can be invoked to perform one of the three possible
actions (The action is chosen based on the number of arguments):

1. retrieve the value:
   ```ts
   const value = signal();
   ```
2. update the value:
   ```ts
   signal(3);
   ```
3. create a [tween](/docs/tweening) for the value:
   ```ts
   yield * signal(2, 0.3);
   ```

Instead of the actual value, a signal can be provided with a function that
computes the value dynamically. Consider the following example:

```ts
const radius = createSignal(1);
const area = createSignal(() => Math.PI * radius() * radius());

console.log(area()); // 3.141592653589793
radius(2);
console.log(area()); // 12.566370614359172
```

Here, the `area` signal uses the `radius` signal to compute its value.

## Explanation

To better understand how signals work, let's modify the example from before to
see when exactly the area is calculated:

```ts
const radius = createSignal(1);
const area = createSignal(() => {
  console.log('area recalculated!');
  return Math.PI * radius() * radius();
});

area(); // area recalculated!
area();
radius(2);
area(); // area recalculated!
radius(3);
radius(4);
area(); // area recalculated!
```

This demonstrates three important aspects of signals:

### Laziness

Signals are only calculated when their value is requested. The first
`"area recalculated!"` message is logged to console only after `area()` is
called.

### Caching

Once the signal is calculated, its value is saved and then returned during
subsequent calls to `area()`. That's why nothing is logged to the console during
the second call. This aspect of signals makes them perfect for caching
computationally heavy operations. In fact, Motion Canvas uses signals internally
to cache things such as matrices.

### Dependency tracking

The `area` signal keeps track of other signals it depends on. When we change the
`radius` signal, the `area` signal is notified about that. But it doesn't get
recalculated immediately - laziness is still at play. We can modify the radius
however many times we want, but the `area` will be recalculated only once its
value is requested again by calling `area()`.

## Complex example

We can use the fact that properties of nodes are represented by signals to
construct scenes that automatically update when the data changes. Following the
previous example, let's create a visualisation for the area of the circle:

<AnimationPlayer small name="node-signal" />

Below you'll find the code used to create this animation. We highlighted all the
places where signals are used:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{signalSource}</CodeBlock>

With this setup, all we need to do is animate the `radius` signal, and the rest
of the scene will adjust accordingly:

```ts
yield * radius(4, 2).to(3, 2);
```
