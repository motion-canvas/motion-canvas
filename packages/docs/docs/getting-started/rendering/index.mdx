# Rendering

The Video Settings tab serves as the main control panel for all things related
to the display of your animation. You can open it by pressing the <VideoSettings
  className="icon-inline"
  alt="Video Settings"
  title="Video Settings"
/> icon. Here, you can configure various animation settings, initialize the
rendering process, and enter the presentation mode.

## Configuration

### Background

The background of your animation. This is the base color used to clear the
canvas before drawing your scenes. Most color formats such as `#242424` or
`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)` are accepted. Leaving this option empty will make the
background transparent.

:::tip

The project background cannot be animated. You can use the `fill` property of
the view, instead:

```ts
export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  view.fill('#242424'); // set the background of this scene
  yield* view.fill('lightseagreen', 2); // animate it
});
```

### Range

The range is the span of frames that will be rendered. If set to a smaller range
than the entire length of the video, it will only render a portion of the frames
in your animation. This can be useful for quickly rendering small changes in
your animation.

### Resolution

The resolution in pixels of each frame in the video. You may use this value to
render in a higher resolution or to change the aspect ratio. Note, however, that
animations will not scale with changes in resolution, so plan ahead for any
adjustments to resolution.

### Audio offset

This option is only available if you've [set up audio](/docs/media#audio) for
the current project. It allows you to offset the start of the audio in relation
to your animation. The value is stored in seconds. You can also adjust the
offset by holding <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> over the audio track and dragging it left or
right.

### Frame rate

The frame rate at which the animation plays and the number of frames that will
render per one second of runtime. The most common values are 24, 30, and 60,
though any whole integer value is allowed. Motion Canvas animations are
resilient to changes in frame rate, so most animations will not be affected by
changing it.

### Scale

Scale will increase or decrease the resolution of the animation, but, unlike the
Resolution option, the coordinates and size of animation elements will be
adjusted as well.

:::tip

Both Scale and Frame rate can be configured separately for the preview and the
rendering. This lets you increase the performance of the preview (by rendering
in smaller resolution and/or lower framerate) while rendering in high quality.

:::

### Color Space

The HTML Canvas color space to use when previewing or rendering the animation.
Current options include sRGB, a common color space for images and video, and
DCI-P3, a wide-gamut color space.

### Exporter

The exporter to use when rendering the animation. Exporters are responsible for
processing the rendered frames and saving them to the output directory. If you
don't see this option, it means that you don't have any additional exporters
installed and the default _Image sequence_ exporter will be used.

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />

## Rendering

Clicking the `RENDER` button will initialize rendering (The button will display
an in-progress animation during the process). Motion Canvas will play through
the animation and save the result to `/output` in your project directory. You
can [change the output directory](/docs/configuration#output) in the
configuration file. You can also use the `OUTPUT DIRECTORY` button to reveal the
current output directory in your file explorer.

The rendering process will finish once the button changes back to `RENDER`.
Usually, this happens when the playhead reaches the end of the selected range
but some exporters may take longer to finish processing the frames.

You can abort the process at any time by pressing the `ABORT` button.

## Taking Snapshots

You can use the <PhotoCamera className="icon-inline"/> icon to take a snapshot
of the current frame. Snapshots are saved in the output directory, under
`/still`.
