# Animation flow

Motion Canvas uses generator functions to describe animations.

A generator function is a function that can return multiple values:

```ts
function* example() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const generator = example();

console.log(generator.next().value); // 1;
console.log(generator.next().value); // 2;
console.log(generator.next().value); // 3;
```

When the `yield` keyword is encountered, the execution of the function pauses,
and resumes only when the caller requests another value. This is particularly
useful when declaring animations - usually we want to change the things on the
screen in incremental steps to create an illusion of movement. We also want to
wait a constant amount of time between these updates so that our eyes can
register what's happening. With generators, we can update things in-between the
`yield` keywords, and then wait for a bit whenever the function yields.

This is the fundamental idea of Motion Canvas. `yield` means: "The current frame
is ready, display it on the screen and come back to me later."

With that in mind, we can make a circle flicker on the screen using the
following code:

```tsx
export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const circle = createRef<Circle>();
  view.add(<Circle ref={circle} width={100} height={100} />);

  circle().fill('red');
  yield;
  circle().fill('blue');
  yield;
  circle().fill('red');
  yield;
});
```

Needless to say, it would be extremely cumbersome if we had to write all
animations like that. Fortunately, JavaScript has another keyword for use within
generators - `yield*`. It allows us to delegate the yielding to another
generator.

For instance, we could extract the flickering code from the above example to a
separate generator and delegate our scene function to it:

```tsx
import {ThreadGenerator} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const circle = createRef<Circle>();
  view.add(<Circle ref={circle} width={100} height={100} />);

  yield* flicker(circle());
});

function* flicker(circle: Circle): ThreadGenerator {
  circle.fill('red');
  yield;
  circle.fill('blue');
  yield;
  circle.fill('red');
  yield;
}
```

The resulting animation is exactly the same, but now we have a reusable function
that we can use whenever we need some flickering.

Motion Canvas provides a lot of useful generators like this. You may remember
this snippet from [quickstart](/docs/quickstart):

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
```

It animates the fill color of the circle from its current value to `#e6a700`
over a span of one second. As you may guess, the result of calling
`fill('#e6a700', 1)` is another generator to which we can redirect our scene
function. Generators like this are called tweens, because they animate
be**tween** two values. You can read more about them in the
[tweening](/docs/tweening) section.

## Flow Generators

Another kind of generators are _flow generators_. They take one or more
generators as their input and combine them together. We've mentioned the `all()`
generator in the quickstart section, there's a few more:

### `all`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/core/flow#all'} />
<hr />

### `any`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/core/flow#any'} />
<hr />

### `chain`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/core/flow#chain'} />
<hr />

### `delay`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/core/flow#delay'} />
<hr />

### `sequence`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/core/flow#sequence'} />
<hr />

### `loop`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/core/flow#loop'} />
<hr />

## Looping

There are many ways to animate multiple objects. Here are some examples. Try
using them in the below editor.

```tsx editor ratio=2
import {makeScene2D, Rect} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {all, waitFor, makeRef, range} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/flow';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const rects: Rect[] = [];

  // Create some rects
  view.add(
    range(5).map(i => (
      <Rect
        ref={makeRef(rects, i)}
        width={100}
        height={100}
        x={-250 + 125 * i}
        fill="#88C0D0"
        radius={10}
      />
    )),
  );

  yield* waitFor(1);

  // Animate them
  yield* all(
    ...rects.map(rect => rect.position.y(100, 1).to(-100, 2).to(0, 1)),
  );
});
```

### Using `Array.map` and `all`

This is one of the most elegant ways to do simple tweens, but requires nesting
`all` to do multiple tweens on an object since the `map` callback must return a
`ThreadGenerator`.

```tsx
yield *
  all(
    ...rects.map(rect =>
      // No yield or anything; we return this generator and deal with it outside
      rect.position.y(100, 1).to(-100, 2).to(0, 1),
    ),
  );
```

### Using a `for` loop and `all`

This is similar to above, but uses a `for` loop and an array of generators.

```tsx
const generators = [];
for (const rect of rects) {
  // No yield here, just store the generators.
  generators.push(rect.position.y(100, 1).to(-100, 2).to(0, 1));
}

// Run all of the generators.
yield * all(...generators);
```

### Using a `for` loop

This is a bit of a cumbersome option because you have to figure out how long it
would take for the generator in the loop to complete, but is useful in some
situations.

```tsx
for (const rect of rects) {
  // Note the absence of a * after this yield
  yield rect.position.y(100, 1).to(-100, 2).to(0, 1);
}

// Wait for the duration of the above generators
yield * waitFor(4);
```
