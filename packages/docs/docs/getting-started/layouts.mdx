# Layouts

<AnimationPlayer name="layout" banner />

Layouts allow you to arrange your nodes using [Flexbox][flexbox]. Any node
extending the [`Layout`](/api/2d/components/Layout) node can become a part of
the layout. This includes, but is not limited to:
[`Rect`](/api/2d/components/Rect), [`Circle`](/api/2d/components/Circle), and
[`Image`](/api/2d/components/Image).

## Layout root

Layouts are an opt-in feature, meaning that they need to be enabled. It's done
by setting the [`layout`](/api/2d/components/Layout#layout) property on the Node
that we want to become the root of our layout:

```tsx
// ↓ layout root
<Rect layout>
  {/* ↓ layout child */}
  <Circle width={320} height={320} />
</Rect>
```

In the example above, we marked the `<Rect>` as the layout root. This will cause
the position and size of its descendants to be controlled by Flexbox (In this
case there's only one valid descendant: `<Circle>`). The layout root itself is
treated differently than its children - its size is controlled by Flexbox, but
the position stays unaffected.

:::info

Just setting the `layout` property doesn't always turn the node into a layout
root. If the node is already a part of the layout, it will be treated like the
rest of the descendants:

```tsx
// ↓ layout root
<Rect layout>
  {/* ↓ layout child, NOT a layout root */}
  <Rect layout>
    {/* ↓ layout child */}
    <Circle width={320} height={320} />
  </Rect>
</Rect>
```

## Size and offset

Aside from the position, rotation, and scale, any node extending the `Layout`
class has additional `size` and `offset` properties:

### `Layout.size`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/2d/components/Layout#size'} />
<hr />

### `Layout.offset`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/2d/components/Layout#offset'} />
<hr />

## Flexbox configuration

Most flexbox attributes available in CSS are available as
[`Layout` properties](/api/2d/components/Layout#Properties). You can check out
this [Flexbox guide][flexbox] to better understand how they work. The most
useful properties are listed below:

### `Layout.padding`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/2d/components/Layout#padding'} />
<hr />

### `Layout.margin`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/2d/components/Layout#margin'} />
<hr />

### `Layout.gap`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/2d/components/Layout#gap'} />
<hr />

### `Layout.direction`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/2d/components/Layout#direction'} />
<hr />

### `Layout.alignItems`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/2d/components/Layout#alignItems'} />
<hr />

### `Layout.justifyContent`

<ApiSnippet url={'/api/2d/components/Layout#justifyContent'} />
<hr />

## Groups

Nodes that don't extend the `Layout` class, such as the `Node` itself, are
unaffected by the layout and are treated as if they were never there. This lets
you apply filters and transformations to layout nodes without affecting the
hierarchy.

From the layout's perspective, all `<Rect>`s in the example below are siblings:

```tsx
<Layout direction={'column'} width={960} gap={40} layout>
  <Node opacity={0.1}>
    <Rect height={240} fill={'#ff6470'} />
    <Rect height={240} fill={'#ff6470'} />
  </Node>
  <Rect height={240} fill={'#ff6470'} />
</Layout>
```
