# Quickstart

In this guide, we'll create a simple animation using Motion Canvas.

### Prerequisites

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or greater is installed
on your machine.

:::tip

You can run the following command to check if Node.js is already installed:

```bash
node -v
```

:::

### Creating a new project

Run the following command in order to scaffold a new Motion Canvas project (If
the command fails check out the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section
below):

```bash
npm init @motion-canvas@latest
```

Answer the prompts to name your project and select which language you would like
to use; either TypeScript or plain JavaScript. We recommend using TypeScript in
your first project, since that's the language we're using throughout this
documentation.

You'll also be asked to choose how you'd like to export your animations. Motion
Canvas comes with a built-in [_Image sequence_](/docs/rendering/image-sequence)
exporter - perfect if you want to import your animations into a video editor.
However, if you want to directly produce a finished video, you can choose to
install the [_Video (FFmpeg)_](/docs/rendering/video) exporter. Don't worry, you
can select multiple exporters, and you can always
[add more](/docs/rendering/video#existing-project) later.

To complete the scaffolding process, you'll need to run the following commands:

1. **C**hange **D**irectory (`cd`) to the project root (You should replace
   `<project-path>` with the path you picked during scaffolding):
   ```shell
   cd <project-path>
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the editor:
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```
   The editor can be accessed by visiting
   [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/). We'll use it to preview our
   animation, although for now there's not much to see.

### Programming an animation

The scaffolding command will create several files for you, but for now we're
going to focus on `src/scenes/example.tsx`, which is where we can add our
animations. Open `example.tsx` in a text editor, and replace all code in the
file with the following snippet.

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Circle} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {all, createRef} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const myCircle = createRef<Circle>();

  view.add(
    <Circle
      ref={myCircle}
      // try changing these properties:
      x={-300}
      width={140}
      height={140}
      fill="#e13238"
    />,
  );

  yield* all(
    myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1),
    myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1),
  );
});
```

Now save the file. Any changes you make are automatically picked up and
reflected in the preview.

You should see a red circle in the preview pane at the top right of the web
application. Press the play button to see the circle animate across the screen.

### Explanation

Each video in Motion Canvas is represented by a project configuration object. In
our example, this configuration is declared in `src/project.ts`:

```ts title="src/project.ts"
import {makeProject} from '@motion-canvas/core';

import example from './scenes/example?scene';

export default makeProject({
  scenes: [example],
});
```

When creating a project, we need to provide it with an array of scenes to
display. In this case, we use only one scene imported from
`src/scenes/example.tsx`.

A scene is a set of elements displayed on the screen and an animation that
governs them. The most basic scene looks as follows:

```tsx
import {makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  // animation
});
```

`makeScene2D()` takes a function generator and turns it into a scene which we
then import in our project file. The function generator describes the flow of
the animation, while the provided `view` argument is used to add elements to the
scene.

You can learn more about scenes, nodes, and this XML-like syntax in the
[scene hierarchy](/docs/hierarchy) section. For now, what's important is that,
in our example, we add an individual [`<Circle/>`](/api/2d/components/Circle)
node to our scene. We make it red, set its width and height as `140` pixels and
position it `300` pixels left from the center:

```tsx
view.add(
  <Circle
    // highlight-start
    ref={myCircle}
    x={-300}
    width={140}
    height={140}
    fill="#e13238"
  />,
);
```

To animate our circle we first need to
[grab a reference to it](/docs/references). That's the purpose of the
[`createRef`](/api/core/utils#createRef) function. We use it to create a
reference and pass it to our circle using the
[`ref`](/api/2d/components/NodeProps#ref) attribute:

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
const myCircle = createRef<Circle>();

view.add(
  <Circle
    // highlight-next-line
    ref={myCircle}
    x={-300}
    width={140}
    height={140}
    fill="#e13238"
  />,
);
```

We then access the circle through `myCircle()` and animate its properties:

```tsx
yield *
  all(
    myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1),
    myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1),
  );
```

This snippet may seem a bit confusing so let's break it down.

Each property of a node can be read and updated throughout the animation. For
example, in the circle above we defined its `fill` property as `'#e13238'`:

```tsx
<Circle
  ref={myCircle}
  x={-300}
  width={140}
  height={140}
  // highlight-next-line
  fill="#e13238"
/>
```

Using our reference we can now retrieve this property's value:

```ts
const fill = myCircle().fill(); // '#e13238'
```

We can also update it by passing the new value as the first argument:

```ts
myCircle().fill('#e6a700');
```

This will immediately update the color of our circle. If we want to transition
to a new value over some time, we can pass the transition duration (in seconds)
as the second argument:

```ts
myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
```

This [creates a tween animation](/docs/tweening) that smoothly changes the fill
color over one second.

Animations in Motion Canvas don't play on their own, we need to explicitly tell
them to. This is why scenes are declared using generator functions - they serve
as a description of how the animation should play out. By yielding different
instructions we can tell the scene animation to do different things.

For example, to play the tween we created, we can do:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
```

This will pause the generator, play out the animation we yielded, and then
continue.

To play another animation, right after the first one, we can simply write
another `yield*` statement:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
yield * myCircle().fill('#e13238', 1);
```

But since we're animating the same property, we can write it in a more compact
way:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1);
```

In our example, aside from changing the color, we also move our circle around.
We can try doing it the same way we animated the color:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1);
yield * myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1);
```

This works, but the position will start animating **after** the fill color. To
make them happen at the same time, we use the [`all`][all] function:

```ts
yield *
  all(
    myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1),
    myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1),
  );
```

[`all`][all] takes one or more animations and merges them together. Now they'll
happen at the same time. The [animation flow](/docs/flow) section goes into more
depth about generators and flow functions such as [`all`][all].

This brings us back to our initial example:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="src/scenes/example.tsx">

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>
    <code>npm init @motion-canvas@latest</code> fails to execute.
  </summary>

There was [a bug in npm](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/5175) causing the
above command to fail. It got fixed in version `8.15.1`. You can follow
[this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm) to
update your npm. Alternatively, you can use the following command instead:

```bash
npm exec @motion-canvas/create@latest
```

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <code>npm install</code> fails with <code>code ENOENT</code>
  </summary>

If `npm install` fails with the following error:

```bash
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall open
npm ERR! path [path]\package.json
npm ERR! errno -4058
npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '[path]\package.json'
npm ERR! enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.
npm ERR! enoent
```

Make sure that you're executing the command in the correct directory. When you
finish bootstrapping the project with `npm init`, it will display three
commands:

```bash
cd [path]
npm install
npm start
```

Did you run the `cd` command to switch to the directory containing your project?

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    I moved the camera too far away and can't find the preview (The preview is in black)
  </summary>

You can press `0` to refocus the camera on the preview.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    The animation ends abruptly or does not start at the beginning.
  </summary>

Make sure the playback range selector in the timeline starts and ends where you
expect it to, e.g., at the beginning and end of your animation. The range
selector is a gray bar in the time axis of your timeline. When you move your
mouse over it, six dots will appear allowing you to manipulate it.

  <summary>
    File watching does not work on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2
  </summary>

When running Vite on WSL2, file system watching does not work if a file is
edited by Windows applications.

To fix this, move the project folder into the WSL2 file system and use WSL2
applications to edit files. Accessing the Windows file system from WSL2 is slow,
so this will improve performance.

For more information view the
[**Vite Docs**](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-watch).
