# Quickstart

In this guide, we'll create a simple animation using Motion Canvas.

### Prerequisites

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or greater is installed
on your machine.

:::tip

You can run the following command to check if Node.js is already installed:

```bash
node -v
```

:::

### Creating a new project

Run the following command in order to scaffold a new Motion Canvas project:

```bash
npm init @motion-canvas
```

Answer the prompts to name your project and select which language you would like
to use; either TypeScript or plain JavaScript.

:::tip

We recommend using TypeScript in your first project, since that's the language
we're using throughout this documentation.

:::

To complete the scaffolding process, run the following command in your newly
created project directory:

```shell
npm install
```

### Starting the editor

To start the editor, run:

```shell
npm run serve
```

The editor can be accessed by visiting
[http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/). We'll use it to preview our
animation, but for now there's not much to see.

### Programming an animation

The scaffolding command will create several files for you, but for now we're
going to focus on `src/scenes/example.tsx`, which is where we can add our
animations. Open `example.tsx` in a text editor, and replace all code in the
file with the following snippet.

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="src/scenes/example.tsx">
  {source}
</CodeBlock>

Now save the file. Any changes you make are automatically picked up and
reflected in the preview. You should see a gray circle in the preview pane at
the top right of the web application. Press the play button to see the circle
animate across the screen.

<AnimationPlayer small name="quickstart" />

Depending on the size of your browser, you may want to zoom the preview out by
scrolling down on your mouse wheel while hovering over the preview panel.

### Explanation

Each video in Motion Canvas is represented by an instance of the `Project`
class. In our example, the project is declared in `src/project.ts`:

```ts title="src/project.ts"
import {Project} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib';

import example from './scenes/example?scene';

export default new Project({
  scenes: [example],
});
```

When creating a project, we need to provide it with an array of scenes to
display. In this case, we use only one scene imported from
`src/scenes/example.tsx`.

A scene is a set of elements displayed on the screen and an animation that
governs them. The most basic scene looks as follows:

```tsx
import {makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/scenes';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  // animation
});
```

`makeScene2D()` takes a function generator and turns it into a scene which we
then import in our project file. The function generator describes the flow of
the animation, while the provided `view` argument is used to add elements to the
scene.

You can learn more about scenes, nodes, and this XML-like syntax in the
[scene hierarchy](/docs/hierarchy) section. For now, what's important is that,
in our example, we add an individual [`<Circle/>`](/api/2d/components/Circle)
node to our scene. We make it red, set its width and height as `240` pixels and
position it `300` pixels left from the center:

```tsx
view.add(
  <Circle
    // highlight-start
    ref={myCircle}
    x={-300}
    width={240}
    height={240}
    fill="#e13238"
  />,
);
```

To animate our circle we first need to
[grab a reference to it](/docs/references). That's the purpose of the
[`createRef`](/api/core/utils#createRef) function. We use it to create a
reference and pass it to our circle using the
[`ref`](/api/2d/components/NodeProps#ref) attribute:

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
const myCircle = createRef<Circle>();

view.add(
  <Circle
    // highlight-next-line
    ref={myCircle}
    x={-300}
    width={240}
    height={240}
    fill="#e13238"
  />,
);
```

We then access the circle through `myCircle()` and animate its properties:

```tsx
yield *
  all(
    myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1),
    myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1),
  );
```

This snippet may seem a bit confusing so let's break it down.

Each property of a node can be read and updated throughout the animation. For
example, in the circle above we defined its `fill` property as `'#e13238'`:

```tsx
<Circle
  ref={myCircle}
  x={-300}
  width={240}
  height={240}
  // highlight-next-line
  fill="#e13238"
/>
```

Using our reference we can now retrieve this property's value:

```ts
const fill = myCircle().fill(); // '#e13238'
```

We can also update it by passing the new value as the first argument:

```ts
myCircle().fill('#e6a700');
```

This will immediately update the color of our circle. If we want to transition
to a new value over some time, we can pass the transition duration (in seconds)
as the second argument:

```ts
myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
```

This [creates a tween animation](/docs/tweening) that smoothly changes the fill
color over one second.

Animations in Motion Canvas don't play on their own, we need to explicitly tell
them to. This is why scenes are declared using generator functions - they serve
as a description of how the animation should play out. By yielding different
instructions we can tell the scene animation to do different things.

For example, to play the tween we created, we can do:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
```

This will pause the generator, play out the animation we yielded, and then
continue.

To play another animation, right after the first one, we can simply write
another `yield*` statement:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
yield * myCircle().fill('#e13238', 1);
```

But since we're animating the same property, we can write it in a more compact
way:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1);
```

In our example, aside from changing the color, we also move our circle around.
We can try doing it the same way we animated the color:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1);
yield * myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1);
```

This works, but the position will start animating **after** the fill color. To
make them happen at the same time, we use the [`all`][all] function:

```ts
yield *
  all(
    myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1),
    myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1),
  );
```

[`all`][all] takes one or more animations and merges them together. Now they'll
happen at the same time. The [animation flow](/docs/flow) section goes into more
depth about generators and flow functions such as [`all`][all].

This brings us back to our initial example:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="src/scenes/example.tsx">
  {source}
</CodeBlock>
