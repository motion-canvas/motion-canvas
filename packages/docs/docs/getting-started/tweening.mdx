# Tweening

Tweens are one of the fundamental building blocks of animation. They are a
special type of generators that animate between two values over given time.

## `tween` function

The simplest way to create a tween is via the
[`tween`](/api/core/tweening#tween) function:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{linearSource}</CodeBlock>

In the example above, we animate the x coordinate of our circle from `-300` to
`300` over a span of `2` second.

The [`tween`](/api/core/tweening#tween) function takes two parameters. The first
one specifies the tween duration in seconds. The second is a callback function
that will be called each frame the tween takes place. The `value` parameter it
receives is a number ranging from `0` to `1`, informing us about the progress of
the tween. We can use it to calculate the values that our tween animates. In the
case of our circle, we use the `map` function to map the `value` range from
`[0, 1]` to `[-300, 300]` and set it as the `x` coordinate:

<AnimationPlayer small name="tweening-linear" />

### Timing functions

At the moment, our animation feels a bit unnatural. The speed with which the
`value` parameter changes is constant, which in turn makes the circle move with
constant speed. In real life, however, objects have inertia - they take time to
speed up and slow down. We can simulate this behavior with
[timing functions](/api/core/tweening).

A timing function takes a number in the range `[0, 1]` and returns another
number in the same range but with a modified rate of change. Motion Canvas
provides all [the most popular timing functions](https://easings.net/)
(sometimes called easing functions) but since it's a normal JavaScript function
you can create your own.

Let's use the [`easeInOutCubic`](/api/core/tweening#easeInOutCubic) function to
fix our animation:

```ts
yield *
  tween(2, value => {
    circle().position.x(map(-300, 300, easeInOutCubic(value)));
  });
```

<AnimationPlayer small name="tweening-cubic" />

`easeInOut` means that the object will speed up at the start (`in`) and slow
down at the end (`Out`). `Cubic` denotes the mathematical function used - in
this case it's a cubic equation. Knowing that, a function called `easeOutQuad`
would make the object start with full speed and then slow down at the end using
a quadratic equation.

The effects of a particular easing function can be visualised by animating the
`y` coordinate of an object as time changes with a constant rate, such as
bouncing it in and out.

<AnimationPlayer small name="tweening-visualiser" />

Because using timing functions to map a range of values is a really common
pattern, it's possible to skip `map` entirely and pass the range to the timing
function itself:

```ts
// This:
map(-300, 300, easeInOutCubic(value));
// Can be simplified to:
easeInOutCubic(value, -300, 300);
```

### Interpolation functions

So far, we've only animated a single, numeric value. The
[`map`](/api/core/tweening#map) function can be used to interpolate between two
numbers but to animate more complex types we'll need to use interpolation
functions. Consider the following example:

```ts
// import { Color } from "@motion-canvas/core";
yield *
  tween(2, value => {
    circle().fill(
      Color.lerp(
        new Color('#e6a700'),
        new Color('#e13238'),
        easeInOutCubic(value),
      ),
    );
  });
```

`Color.lerp` is a static function that interpolates between two colors:

<AnimationPlayer small name="tweening-color" />

:::tip

All [complex types](/api/core/types) in Motion Canvas provide a static method
called `lerp` that interpolates between two instances of said type.

:::

Aside from the default linear interpolation, some types offer more advanced
functions such as the [`Vector2.arcLerp`](/api/core/types/Vector2#arcLerp). It
makes the object follow a curved path from point a to b:

```ts
yield *
  tween(2, value => {
    circle().position(
      // highlight-next-line
      Vector2.arcLerp(
        new Vector2(-300, 200),
        new Vector2(300, -200),
        easeInOutCubic(value),
      ),
    );
  });
```

### Tweening properties

The [`tween`](/api/core/tweening#tween) function is useful when we need to
orchestrate complex animations. However, there's a better way of tweening
individual properties. You may recall from the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart)
section that the following tween:

```ts
yield *
  tween(2, value => {
    circle().color(
      Color.lerp(
        new Color('#e6a700'),
        new Color('#e13238'),
        easeInOutCubic(value),
      ),
    );
  });
```

Can be written as:

```ts
yield * circle().color('#e13238', 2);
```

Here, we use a [`SignalTween`](/api/core/signals/SignalTween) signature that
looks similar to a setter, except it accepts the transition duration as its
second argument. Under the hood, this will also create a tween - one that starts
with the current value and ends with the newly provided one.

We can chain multiple tweens together by calling the `to()` method on the
returned object:

```ts
yield * circle().color('#e13238', 2).to('#e6a700', 2);
```

By default, property tweens use `easeInOutCubic` as the timing function. We can
override that by providing a third argument:

```ts
yield *
  circle().color(
    '#e13238',
    2,
    // highlight-next-line
    easeOutQuad,
  );
```

Similarly, we can pass a custom interpolation function as the fourth argument:

```ts
yield *
  circle().position(
    new Vector2(300, -200),
    2,
    easeInOutCubic,
    // highlight-next-line
    Vector2.arcLerp,
  );
```

## `spring` function

The [`spring`](/api/core/tweening#spring) function allows us to interpolate
between two values using Hooke's law. We need to provide it with the description
of our spring and the `from` and `to` values. You can think of it as having a
spring in resting position (the `to` value), stretching it all the way to the
starting position (the `from` value), and then letting it go. The movement of
the spring as it tries to reach the equilibrium is what we can use to dive our
animations.

In the example below, we use springs to animate a position of a circle, but this
method can be used for more things than just position.

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{springSource}</CodeBlock>

<AnimationPlayer small name="tweening-spring" />

### Spring description

The first argument of the [`spring`](/api/core/tweening#spring) function expects
an object that describes the physical properties of our spring. Motion Canvas
ships with a few useful presets that you can use, such as `PlopSpring` and
`SmoothSpring`. But it's possible to define your own spring:

```ts
const MySpring = {
  mass: 0.04,
  stiffness: 10.0,
  damping: 0.7,
  initialVelocity: 8.0,
};
```

- `mass` - Describes the inertia of the spring. How much force is required to
  accelerate and decelerate it.
- `stiffness` - The coefficient of the spring. Usually represented by `k` in
  Hooke's equation. It describes how stiff the spring is.
- `damping` - Over time, damping causes the spring to lose energy and eventually
  settle in equilibrium. You can set it to `0` to create a spring that
  oscillates indefinitely.
- `initialVelocity` - The initial velocity of the spring. You can set the `from`
  and `to` positions to the same value and give the spring some initial velocity
  to make it oscillate in place.

### Settle tolerance

Notice how in our spring example, we provided the first spring with an
additional value:

```ts
yield * spring(PlopSpring, -400, 400, 1 /*...*/);
//                               here ^
```

This optional argument is called `settleTolerance` and is used to define the
minimal distance from the `to` value the spring should reach to be considered
settled. The generator created by the [`spring`](/api/core/tweening#spring)
function finishes **only** when the spring settles. By adjusting the tolerance
we can make the animation finish faster, depending on our needs. In our example
we animate the position so a tolerance of `1` means that the spring needs to be
at most `1` pixel away from the `to` value.

## Saving and restoring states

All nodes provide a [`save`](/api/2d/components/Node#save) method which allows
us to save a snapshot of the node's current state. We can then use the
[`restore`](/api/2d/components/Node#restore) method at a later point in our
animation to restore the node to the previously saved state.

```ts
// highlight-next-line
circle().save();
yield * circle().position(new Vector2(300, -200), 2);
// highlight-next-line
yield * circle().restore(1);
```

It is also possible to provide a custom [timing function](/api/core/tweening) to
the [`restore`](/api/2d/components/Node#restore) method.

```ts
yield * circle().restore(1, linear);
```

Node states get stored on a stack. This makes it possible to save more than one
state by invoking the [`save`](/api/2d/components/Node#save) method multiple
times. When calling [`restore`](/api/2d/components/Node#restore), the node will
be restored to the most recently saved state by popping the top entry in the
state stack. If there is no saved state, this method does nothing.

The example below shows a more complete example of how we can store and restore
multiple states across an animation.
