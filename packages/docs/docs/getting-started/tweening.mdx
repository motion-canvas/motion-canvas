# Tweening

Tweens are one of the fundamental building blocks of animation.
They are a special type of generators that animate between two values
over given time.

## `tween` function

The simplest way to create a tween is via the
[`tween`](/api/core/tweening#tween) function:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{linearSource}</CodeBlock>

In the example above, we animate the x coordinate of our circle
from `-300` to `300` over a span of `2` second.

The [`tween`](/api/core/tweening#tween) function takes two parameters.
The first one specifies the tween duration in seconds. The second is
a callback function that will be called each frame the tween takes
place. The `value` parameter it recieves is a number ranging from `0`
to `1`, informing us about the progress of the tween. We can use it to
calculate the values that our tween animates. In the case of our circle,
we use the `map` function to map the `value` range from `[0, 1]` to
`[-300, 300]` and set it as the `x` coordinate:

## Timing functions

At the moment, our animation feels a bit unnatural. The speed with which
the `value` parameter changes is constant, which in turn makes the circle
move with constant speed. In real life, however, objects have inertia -
they take time to speed up and slow down. We can simulate this behavior
with [timing functions](/api/core/tweening).

A timing function takes a number in the range `[0, 1]` and returns another
number in the same range but with a modified rate of change.
Motion Canvas provides all
[the most popular timing functions](https://easings.net/) (sometimes called
easing functions) but since it's a normal JavaScript function you can create
your own.

Let's use the [`easeInOutCubic`](/api/core/tweening#easeInOutCubic) function
to fix our animation:

```ts
yield* tween(2, value => {
  circle().position.x(map(-300, 300, easeInOutCubic(value)));
});
```

<AnimationPlayer small name="tweening-cubic" />

`easeInOut` means that the object will speed up at the start (`in`) and slow
down at the end (`Out`). `Cubic` denotes the mathematical function used -
in this case it's a cubic equation. Knowing that, a function called
`easeOutQuad` would make the object start with full speed and then slow down
at the end using a quadratic equation.

Because using timing functions to map a range of values is a really common
pattern, it's possible to skip `map` entirely and pass the range to the
timing function itself:

```ts
// This:
map(-300, 300, easeInOutCubic(value));
// Can be simplified to:
easeInOutCubic(value, -300, 300);
```

## Interplation functions

So far, we've only animated a single, numeric value.
The [`map`](/api/core/tweening#map) function can be used to interpolate between
two numbers but to animate more complex types we'll need to use interpolation
functions. Consider the following example:

```ts
yield* tween(2, value => {
  circle().color(
    Color.lerp(
      new Color('#e6a700'),
      new Color('#e13238'),
      easeInOutCubic(value),
    ),
  );
});
```

[`Color.lerp`](/api/core/types/Color#lerp) is a static function that
interpolates between two colors:

<AnimationPlayer small name="tweening-color" />

:::tip

All [complex types](/api/core/types) in Motion Canvas provide a static method
called `lerp` that interpolates between two instances of said type.

:::

Aside from the default linear interpolation, some types offer more advanced
functions such as the [`Vector2.arcLerp`](/api/core/types/Vector2#arcLerp).
It makes the object follow a curved path from point a to b:

```ts
yield* tween(2, value => {
  circle().position(
    // highlight-next-line
    Vector2.arcLerp(
      new Vector2(-300, 200),
      new Vector2(300, -200),
      easeInOutCubic(value),
    ),
  );
});
```

## Tweening properties

The [`tween`](/api/core/tweening#tween) function is useful when we need to
orchestrate complex animations. However, there's a better way of tweening
individual properties. You may recall from the
[quickstart](/docs/quickstart) section that the following
tween:

```ts
yield* tween(2, value => {
  circle().color(
    Color.lerp(
      new Color('#e6a700'),
      new Color('#e13238'),
      easeInOutCubic(value),
    ),
  );
});
```

Can be written as:

```ts
yield* circle().color('#e13238', 2);
```

Here, we use a [`SignalTween`](/api/core/signals/SignalTween) signature that
looks similar to a setter, except it accepts the transition duration as its
second argument. Under the hood, this will also create a tween - one that
starts with the current value and ends with the newly provided one.

We can chain multiple tweens together by calling the
`to()` method on the returned object:
```ts
yield* circle().color('#e13238', 2).to('#e6a700', 2);
```

By default, property tweens use `easeInOutCubic` as the timing function.
We can override that by providing a third argument:

```ts
yield* circle().color(
  '#e13238',
  2,
  // highlight-next-line
  easeOutQuad
);
```

Similarly, we can pass a custom interpolation function as the forth argument:

```ts
yield* circle().position(
  new Vector2(300, -200),
  2,
  easeInOutCubic,
  // highlight-next-line
  Vector2.arcLerp
);
```
