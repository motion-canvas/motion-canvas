# Migrating to version 11.0.0

:::tip

If you're starting a new project, you can quickly scaffold it using:

```bash
npm init @motion-canvas
```

:::

## Install the new version

Upgrade the versions of all motion-canvas packages in your `package.json` file:

```diff
- "@motion-canvas/core": "^10.0.0",
- "@motion-canvas/ui": "^10.0.0",
- "@motion-canvas/vite-plugin": "^10.0.0",
+ "@motion-canvas/core": "^11.0.0",
+ "@motion-canvas/ui": "^11.0.0",
+ "@motion-canvas/vite-plugin": "^11.0.0",
```

To apply the changes, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Update project file

Since version 11, scene file names no longer need to follow the pattern:
`[name].scene.tsx`. Instead, a dedicated `?scene` query flag is used when
importing a scene in the project file:

```diff title="src/project.tsx"
- import example from './scenes/example.scene';
+ import example from './scenes/example?scene';

export default new Project({
  name: 'project',
  scenes: [example],
});
```

:::note

In the above example, we also changed the name of the scene file from
`example.scene.tsx` to `example.tsx`. This way we avoid the redundant `scene`
when importing it.

Of course, if you want, you can keep the old file name and import it as:
`example.scene?scene`.

:::

This instructs our Vite plugin to turn the imported module into a scene. It will
instantiate an adequate class, load its metadata, and set up hot module
replacement.

Thanks to this change, the name of your scene generator function no longer needs
to match its file name. In fact, it can be completely omitted:

```diff title="src/scenes/example.tsx"
- export default makeKonvaScene(function* example(view) {
+ export default makeKonvaScene(function* (view) {
  // ...
});
```
