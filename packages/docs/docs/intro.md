# Introduction

Motion Canvas consists of two main components:

- A TypeScript library that uses generators to program animations.
- An editor providing a real-time preview of said animations.

It's a specialized tool designed to create informative vector animations and
synchronize them with voice-overs. It's not meant to be a replacement for
traditional video editing software.

Aside from providing the preview, the editor allows you to edit certain aspects
of the animation which could otherwise be tedious. You can learn more about this
functionality in the [time events](/docs/time-events) section.

Motion Canvas is a free and open source project. You can help making it better
by reporting bugs, proposing new features, or contributing to the codebase. If
you're interested, our [contribution guide][contributing] will help you get
started.
