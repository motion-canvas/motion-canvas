# Configuration

Motion Canvas is configured in the Vite's configuration file:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import {defineConfig} from 'vite';
import motionCanvas from '@motion-canvas/vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    motionCanvas({
      // custom options
    }),
  ],
});
```

### `project`

- Type: `string | string[]`
- Default: `./src/project.ts`

The import path of the project file, relative to the configuration file.
A project file must contain a default export with an instance of the `Project` class.

When set to an array, the Editor will display a project selection screen,
making it possible to change the project without restarting Vite.

```ts
motionCanvas({
  project: [
    // highlight-start
    './src/firstProject.ts',
    './src/secondProject.ts',
  ],
});
```

### `output`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `./output`

An output path to which the animation will be saved. Relative to the configuration file.

When rendering, the complete path has the following format:

```
[output]/[projectName]/[frameNumber].[extension]
```

Stills are saved to a `still` subdirectory:

```
[output]/still/[projectName]/[frameNumber].[extension]
```

### `bufferedAssets`

- Type: `RegExp`
- Default: `/\.(wav|mp3|ogg)$/`

Defines which assets should be buffered before being sent to the browser.

Streaming larger assets directly from the drive my cause issues with other
applications. For instance, if an audio file is being used in the project,
Adobe Audition will perceive it as "being used by another application"
and refuse to override it.

Buffered assets are first loaded to the memory and then streamed from
there. This leaves the original files open for modification with hot module
replacement still working.

### `editor`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `@motion-canvas/ui`

The import path of the editor package.

This option can be used to develop/use an editor different than the official one.
The path will be resolved using Node.js module resolution rules.
It should lead to a directory containing the following files:

- `editor.html` - The HTML template for the editor.
- `styles.css` - The editor styles.
- `main.js` - A module exporting necessary factory functions.

`main.js` should export the following functions:

- `editor` - Receives the project as its first argument and creates the
  user interface.
- `index` - Receives a list of all projects as its first argument and
  creates the initial page for selecting a project.
