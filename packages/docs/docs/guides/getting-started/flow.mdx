# Animation flow

Motion Canvas uses generator functions to describe animations.

A generator function is a function that can return multiple values:

```ts
function* example() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const generator = example();

console.log(generator.next()); // 1;
console.log(generator.next()); // 2;
console.log(generator.next()); // 3;
```

When the `yield` keyword is encountered, the execution of the function pauses,
and resumes only when the caller requests another value.
This is particularly useful when declaring animations -
usually we want to change the things on the screen in incremental steps
to create an illusion of movement. We also want to wait a constant amount of time
between these updates so that our eyes can register what's happening.
With generators, we can update things in-between the `yield` keywords,
and then wait for a bit whenever the function yields.

This is the fundamental idea of Motion Canvas.
`yield` means: "The current frame is ready, display it on the screen and come back to me later."

With that in mind, we can make a circle flicker on the screen using the following code:

```tsx
export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const circle = useRef<Circle>();
  view.add(<Circle ref={circle} width={100} height={100} />);

  circle.value.fill('red');
  yield;
  circle.value.fill('blue');
  yield;
  circle.value.fill('red');
  yield;
});
```

Needless to say, it would be extremely cumbersome if we had to write all animations like that.
Fortunately, JavaScript has another keyword for use within generators - `yield*`.
It allows us to delegate the yielding to another generator.

For instance, we could extract the flickering code from the above example to
a separate generator and delegate our scene function to it:

```tsx
export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const circle = useRef<Circle>();
  view.add(<Circle ref={circle} width={100} height={100} />);

  yield* flicker(circle.value);
});

function* flicker(circle: Circle) {
  circle.fill('red');
  yield;
  circle.fill('blue');
  yield;
  circle.fill('red');
  yield;
}
```

The resulting animation is exactly the same, but now we have
a reusable function that we can use whenever we need some flickering.

Motion Canvas provides a lot of useful generators like this.
You may remember this snippet from [quickstart](/guides/getting-started/quickstart):

```ts
yield * myCircle.value.fill('#e6a700', 1);
```

It animates the fill color of the circle from its current value to `#e6a700`
over a span of one second. As you may guess, the result of calling `fill('#e6a700', 1)`
is another generator to which we can redirect our scene function.
Generators like this are called tweens, because they animate be**tween** two values.
You can read more about them in the [tweening](/guides/getting-started/tweening) section.

Another kind of generators are _flow generators_. They take one or more generators as
their input and combine them together. We've mentioned the `all()` generator in
the quickstart section, but you can find them all in [the API documentation](/api/core/flow).
