# Migrating to version 10.0.0

:::tip

If you're starting a new project, you can quickly scaffold it using:

```bash
npm init @motion-canvas
```

:::

## Install the new version

Upgrade the versions of all motion-canvas packages in your `package.json` file:

```diff
- "@motion-canvas/core": "^9.0.0",
- "@motion-canvas/ui": "^9.0.0",
+ "@motion-canvas/core": "^10.0.0",
+ "@motion-canvas/ui": "^10.0.0",
```

To apply the changes, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Switch to Vite

Since version 10, Motion Canvas no longer includes an out-of-the box webpack configuration.
Instead, you should use `vite` together with our `@motion-canvas/vite-plugin` to build your projects.
This requires more boilerplate code, but it allows developers to customize the build process
according to their needs.

First, install `vite` and `@motion-canvas/vite-plugin`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vite @motion-canvas/vite-plugin
```

Next, create a `vite.config.ts` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```ts
import {defineConfig} from 'vite';
import motionCanvas from '@motion-canvas/vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [motionCanvas()],
});
```

In `package.json`, replace the `motion-canvas` command with `vite`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
-   "serve": "motion-canvas src/project.ts"
+   "serve": "vite"
  }
```

Notice that we don't specify the input file when invoking the `vite` command.
By default, our vite plugin will look for the `./src/project.ts` file and use it as an entry point.
You can change that in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    motionCanvas({
      project: './src/custom.ts', // your custom entry file.
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Update the entry file

The project file (usually `src/project.ts`) needs the following adjustments:

```diff
- import '@motion-canvas/core/lib/patches';
- import {bootstrap} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/bootstrap';
+ import {Project} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib';

  import example from './scenes/example.scene';

- bootstrap({
+ export default new Project({
    name: 'base-project',
    scenes: [example],
  });
```

First of all, we no longer import the `@motion-canvas/core/lib/patches` module at the top of the file.<br/>
Additionally, the file should now export and instance of the `Project` class.

## Reference the types

The types exposed by Motion Canvas are no longer global.<br/>
Because of this, you need to create an additional `motion-canvas.d.ts` file in the `src` directory:

```ts
/// <reference types="@motion-canvas/core/project" />
```
