# Migrating to version 12.0.0

Migrating from version 11 to 12 would be really cumbersome due to the amount of changes between the two versions.

It's recommended to first finish any animations started with version 11 and only use version 12 for new projects.

You can quickly scaffold a project using the following command:

```bash
npm init @motion-canvas
```
