# Migrating to version 12.0.0

:::tip

If you're starting a new project, you can quickly scaffold it using:

```bash
npm init @motion-canvas
```

:::

## Install the new version

Upgrade the versions of all motion-canvas packages in your `package.json` file:

```diff
- "@motion-canvas/core": "^11.0.0",
- "@motion-canvas/ui": "^11.0.0",
- "@motion-canvas/vite-plugin": "^11.0.0",
+ "@motion-canvas/core": "^12.0.0",
+ "@motion-canvas/ui": "^12.0.0",
+ "@motion-canvas/vite-plugin": "^12.0.0",
```

To apply the changes, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Install the legacy package

Since version 12, the Konva-based renderer has been moved to a separate package called
`@motion-canvas/legacy`. To continue using it, it needs to be installed separately:

```bash
npm install @motion-canvas/legacy
```

## Configure Vite

Add the following plugin in your Vite configuration:

```diff title="vite.config.ts"
  import {defineConfig} from 'vite';
  import motionCanvas from '@motion-canvas/vite-plugin';
+ import legacyRenderer from '@motion-canvas/legacy/vite';

  export default defineConfig({
-   plugins: [motionCanvas()],
+   plugins: [motionCanvas(), legacyRenderer()],
  });
```

## Update imports

Change the necessary imports to use the legacy package:

```diff title="src/scenes/example.tsx"
- import {makeKonvaScene} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/scenes';
+ import {makeKonvaScene} from '@motion-canvas/legacy/lib/scenes';
```

**Not all imports should be changed.** Only the following modules have been moved
to the legacy package and must be updated:

```ts
// all exports from the following modules are now in the legacy package:
import * from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/animations';
import * from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/components';
import * from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/styles';
import * from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/themes';

// only the listed exports from the following modules are now in the legacy package:
import {slide} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/utils';
import {cached, getset, KonvaNode} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/decorators';
import {CanvasHelper} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/helpers';
import {makeKonvaScene, KonvaScene} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/scenes';
```

## Configure TypeScript

Change your `tsconfig.json` to extend the legacy package instead of core:

```diff title="tsconfig.json"
  {
-   "extends": "@motion-canvas/core/tsconfig.project.json",
+   "extends": "@motion-canvas/legacy/tsconfig.project.json",
    "compilerOptions": {
      "baseUrl": "src"
    },
    "include": ["src"]
  }
```

Similarly, change your types reference in `motion-canvas.d.ts`:

```diff title="src/motion-canvas.d.ts"
- /// <reference types="@motion-canvas/core/project" />
+ /// <reference types="@motion-canvas/legacy/project" />
```

## Update function names

`TweenFunction`s are now called `InterpolationFunction`s.
The naming convention has changed. Instead of `[type]Tween` they now use
`[type]Lerp`. For instance: `colorTween` is now `colorLerp`.

`InterpolationFunction`s are now called `TimingFunction`s.
Their individual names haven't changed (`easeInExpo`, `easeOutCubic`, etc.),
but referring to them as timing functions is better aligned with the CSS spec.
