# Custom Components

<AnimationPlayer name="components" banner />

Components are classes like [`Rect`](/api/2d/components/Rect) and
[`Circle`](/api/2d/components/Circle) that can abstract rendering and data
functionality into reusable, modular pieces. To use a component in a scene, add
it to the view and provide arguments to the component.

```tsx
<Switch initialState={false} />
```

To define what arguments a component will take, first define an interface. All
properties of the interface must be wrapped in
[`SignalValue<>`](/api/core/signals#SignalValue) as such:

```tsx
//  You can extend an existing props interface
//  such as LayoutProps, ShapeProps or NodeProps to
//  include their properties alongside the ones you
//  define

export interface SwitchProps extends NodeProps {
  initialState?: SignalValue<boolean>;

  // We don't use color here because we want
  // to be able to pass hex strings and rgb
  // values to accent rather than a `Color`
  accent?: SignalValue<PossibleColor>;
}
```

Next, create a class for your components. The component class must extend
[`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node) or one of its subclasses. If you don't want to
inherit any methods from an existing component, extend your class from `Node`.
We advise extending from the component most similar to the component you are
building. For instance, if you were to make a component including a
[`Layout`](/api/2d/components/Layout), you should extend
[`Layout`](/api/2d/components/Layout) and
[`LayoutProps`](/api/2d/components/LayoutProps).

```tsx
export interface SwitchProps extends NodeProps {
  // properties
}

export class Switch extends Node {
  // implementation
}
```

To use the properties defined in the interface, your class _must_ contain a
property with the same name. Motion Canvas provides type decorators to
facilitate this like `@initial()` and `@signal()`. Click [here](/docs/signals)
for more information on signals.

Here is an example of how you would define such properties:

```tsx
export class Switch extends Node {
  // @initial - optional, sets the property to an
  // initial value if it was not provided.
  @initial(false)
  // @signal - is required by motion canvas
  // for every prop that was passed in.
  @signal()
  public declare readonly initialState: SimpleSignal<boolean, this>;

  @initial('#68ABDF')
  // @colorSignal - some complex types provide a dedicated decorator for
  // signals that takes care of parsing.
  // In this case, `accent` will automatically convert strings into `Color`s
  @colorSignal()
  public declare readonly accent: ColorSignal<this>;
  // ...
}
```

Notice how colors are wrapped in `ColorSignal<>` while any other type (even
user-defined ones) are wrapped in `SimpleSignal<>`. The type does not need to be
passed to color signal as Motion Canvas knows that it must be of a
color-resolvable type. In both, the class is passed at the end of the wrapper to
register the signal to the class. Properties must be initialised with the
`public`, `declare` and `readonly` keywords.

Normal properties can be defined as normal. For example:

```tsx
export class Switch extends Node {
  public constructor(props?: SwitchProps) {
    super({
      // If you wanted to ensure that layout was always
      // true for this component, you could add it here
      // as such:
      // layout: true
      ...props,
    });
    // ...
  }
}
```

The `props` parameter can also be useful outside the `super()` call to access
your data elsewhere. For example, if you were building a component to display an
array, you could use props to set the color of every
[Rect](/api/2d/components/Rect) in the array.

Now we can add elements to the view by using `this.add()`, much like you would
add to a scene's view:

```tsx
export class Switch extends Node {
  public constructor(props?: SwitchProps) {
    // ...
    this.add(
      <Rect>
        <Circle />
      </Rect>,
    );
  }
}
```

Since this is a class, you can also add methods. This is especially useful when
wanting to animate a component easily. Here is an example of a method for
toggling our switch:

```tsx
export class Switch extends Node {
  // ...
  public *toggle(duration: number) {
    yield* all(
      tween(duration, value => {
        // ...
      }),
      tween(duration, value => {
        // ...
      }),
    );
    this.isOn = !this.isOn;
  }
}
```
