# Spline

```tsx editor mode=preview
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Knot} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {createRef} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const spline = createRef<Spline>();

  view.add(
    <Spline ref={spline} lineWidth={4} fill={'#e13238'} closed>
      <Knot position={[-120, -30]} startHandle={[0, 70]} />
      <Knot
        position={[0, -50]}
        startHandle={[-40, -60]}
        endHandle={[40, -60]}
      />
      <Knot position={[120, -30]} startHandle={[0, -70]} />
      <Knot position={[0, 100]} startHandle={[5, 0]} />
    </Spline>,
  );

  yield* spline().scale(0.9, 0.6).to(1, 0.4);
});
```

The [`Spline`][spline] component allows us to draw and animate smooth curves
through a series of control points.

If all you want to do is draw a simple Bézier curve, check out the [Bézier curve
components][bezier-curves], instead.

## Defining control points

In order to draw a spline, we need to specify what its knots are. The `Spline`
component provides multiple ways of specifying these control points which we
will go through in this section.

### Using the `points` property

The easiest way to define a spline's knots is by passing an array of positions
via the spline's `points` property. Each point will be treated as the position
of one of the spline's knots.

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Spline} from '@motion-canvas/2d';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  view.add(
    <Spline
      lineWidth={6}
      stroke={'lightseagreen'}
      points={[
        [-300, 0],
        [-150, -100],
        [150, 100],
        [300, 0],
      ]}
    />,
  );
});
```

The result is a curve that smoothly passes through each of the provided points.

:::info

Remember to provide a `lineWidth` and `stroke` to the spline as it won't be
visible otherwise. Alternatively, you may also specify a `fill` color.

:::

We can alter the shape of the curve by passing a value between `0` and `1` to
the `smoothness` property.

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Spline} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {createRef} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const spline = createRef<Spline>();

  view.add(
    <Spline
      ref={spline}
      lineWidth={6}
      stroke={'lightseagreen'}
      smoothness={0.4}
      points={[
        [-300, 0],
        [-150, -100],
        [150, 100],
        [300, 0],
      ]}
    />,
  );

  yield* spline().smoothness(0, 1).to(1, 1).to(0.4, 1);
});
```

While defining the knots in this way is very simple and can be enough for simple
curves, there is an important limitation to this method: we cannot alter the
position of the knot's handles. Instead, the handles get calculated
automatically so that the curve passes smoothly through each point without any
sharp or sudden turns.

:::info Fun fact

The auto handles are calculated based on the positions of a knot's two
neighboring knots. A spline that calculates the handle positions of its knots in
this way is called a [Cardinal Spline][cardinal-spline].

:::

Let's look at the second way of defining knots to learn how we can more finely
control the shape of our spline.

### Using `Knot` nodes

The second way of defining knots is by—fittingly—using the [Knot][knot] node.
The same spline from above can also be written like this.

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Knot} from '@motion-canvas/2d';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  view.add(
    <Spline lineWidth={6} stroke={'lightseagreen'}>
      <Knot position={[-300, 0]} />
      <Knot position={[-150, -100]} />
      <Knot position={[150, 100]} />
      <Knot position={[300, 0]} />
    </Spline>,
  );
});
```

As you can see, we get the exact same shape we did when using the `points`
property. The advantage of defining the knots with `Knot` nodes is that it also
allows us to control the positions of each knot's handles via the `startHandle`
and `endHandle` properties.

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Knot} from '@motion-canvas/2d';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  view.add(
    <Spline lineWidth={6} stroke={'lightseagreen'}>
      <Knot position={[-300, 0]} />
      <Knot position={[-150, -100]} endHandle={[-100, 0]} />
      <Knot position={[150, 100]} startHandle={[100, 0]} />
      <Knot position={[300, 0]} />
    </Spline>,
  );
});
```

Note that handle positions are relative to the knot's position.

:::note

Similar to using the `points` property, if no explicit handles are provided for
a knot, the handles get calculated automatically so that the curve smoothly
passes through the knot.

:::

#### Mirrored handles

Handles are mirrored by default. This means that when we provide only one of the
handles of a knot, the other one will implicitly be set to a flipped version of
the provided handle.

```tsx
<Knot startHandle={[100, 50]} />
// Is the same as
<Knot startHandle={[100, 50]} endHandle={[-100, -50]} />
```

#### Broken knots

Providing both `startHandle` and `endHandle` results in a so-called **broken
knot**. Broken knots are very useful because they allow us to add sharp corners
to our spline.

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Knot} from '@motion-canvas/2d';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  view.add(
    <Spline lineWidth={16} stroke={'lightseagreen'} closed>
      <Knot position={[-50, -80]} startHandle={[0, 20]} endHandle={[90, 0]} />
      <Knot position={[50, 0]} />
      <Knot position={[-50, 80]} startHandle={[90, 0]} endHandle={[0, -20]} />
    </Spline>,
  );
});
```

#### Blending between user handles and calculated handles

By default, the auto-calculated handles get ignored when at least one of the
`startHandle` or `endHandle` properties is provided. However, it is possible to
blend between user-provided and auto-calculated handles by using the `auto`
property.

```tsx {6,13}
<Spline lineWidth={16} stroke={'lightseagreen'} closed>
  <Knot
    position={[-50, -80]}
    startHandle={[0, 20]}
    endHandle={[90, 0]}
    auto={0.5}
  />
  <Knot position={[50, 0]} />
  <Knot
    position={[-50, 80]}
    startHandle={[90, 0]}
    endHandle={[0, -20]}
    auto={0.5}
  />
</Spline>
```

`auto` should be a value between `0` and `1` and represents the percentage of
how much to blend between the user-provided handles (`0`) and auto-calculated
handles (`1`).

:::tip

`auto` is a compound signal, which means you can specify `startHandleAuto` and
`endHandleAuto` to individually control the blend of each handle.

```tsx {5-6}
<Knot
  position={[0, 0]}
  startHandle={[-50, -50]}
  endHandle={[30, 0]}
  startHandleAuto={0.3}
  endHandleAuto={0.8}
/>
```

:::

Since `auto` is a signal, it can also be animated.

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Knot} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {all, makeRef} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const knots: Knot[] = [];

  view.add(
    <Spline lineWidth={16} stroke={'lightseagreen'} lineJoin={'round'} closed>
      <Knot
        ref={makeRef(knots, 0)}
        position={[-50, -80]}
        startHandle={[0, 20]}
        endHandle={[90, 0]}
      />
      <Knot position={[50, 0]} />
      <Knot
        ref={makeRef(knots, 1)}
        position={[-50, 80]}
        startHandle={[90, 0]}
        endHandle={[0, -20]}
      />
    </Spline>,
  );

  yield* all(...knots.map(knot => knot.auto(1, 1).to(0, 1)));
});
```

## Animating splines

While animating splines isn't too different from animating any other node, this
section aims to illustrate a few of the most common use cases.

### Drawing splines

Similar to the [`Line`][line] component, the `Spline` node provides `start` and
`end` signals which allow us to control the segment of the curve that should be
visible. Both `start` and `end` are values between `0` and `1` and represent the
percentage of the spline's arclength from which to start drawing from.

```tsx {7-8}
<Spline
  points={[
    [-300, 0],
    [-150, -100],
    [150, 100],
  ]}
  start={0.4}
  end={0.8}
/>
```

The example above would draw the spline starting at 40% of the spline's
arclength (`start={0.4}`) and draw it up until 80% of the spline's arclength
(`end={0.8}`).

:::note

When using `start` and `end` in conjunction with `startOffset` and `endOffset`,
`start` and `end` will be relative to the _remaining_ length of the spline after
taking the offset into account.

:::

We can then animate drawing a spline by tweening these properties:

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Spline} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {all, createRef} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const spline = createRef<Spline>();

  view.add(
    <Spline
      ref={spline}
      lineWidth={6}
      stroke={'lightseagreen'}
      points={[
        [-300, 0],
        [-150, -100],
        [150, 100],
        [300, 0],
      ]}
      end={0}
    />,
  );

  yield* spline().end(1, 1.5);
  yield* spline().start(1, 1.5).to(0.5, 1);
  yield* spline().end(0.5, 1);
  yield* all(spline().start(0, 1.5), spline().end(1, 1.5));
});
```

### Animating the knots of a spline

`Knot`s can be animated in much the same way as other components.

:::note

Animating a spline's knots is only possible when using the
[`Knot`](#using-knot-nodes) component, not when using the `points` property.

:::

Below are a few examples of interesting effects that can be achieved by
animating different properties of knots.

:::tip

You can think of `startHandle` and `endHandle` as being the children of the
Knot—changing the knot's position, rotation and scale will also transform the
handles. The only exceptions are `auto` handles which are unaffected by these
transformations.

:::

```tsx editor
// snippet Position
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Knot} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {all, makeRef, PossibleVector2} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const knotPositions: PossibleVector2[] = [
    [-200, 0],
    [-100, -80],
    [0, 80],
    [100, -80],
    [200, 0],
  ];
  const knots: Knot[] = [];

  view.add(
    <Spline lineWidth={6} stroke={'lightseagreen'}>
      {knotPositions.map((pos, i) => (
        <Knot ref={makeRef(knots, i)} position={pos} />
      ))}
    </Spline>,
  );

  yield* all(
    knots[1].position.y(80, 1).to(-80, 1),
    knots[2].position.y(-80, 1).to(80, 1),
    knots[3].position.y(80, 1).to(-80, 1),
  );
});

// snippet Rotation
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Knot} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {createRef, linear} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const knot = createRef<Knot>();

  view.add(
    <Spline lineWidth={6} stroke={'lightseagreen'}>
      <Knot position={[-100, 30]} />
      <Knot ref={knot} position={[0, -50]} startHandle={[-70, 0]} />
      <Knot position={[100, 30]} />
    </Spline>,
  );

  yield* knot().rotation(360, 3, linear).to(0, 3);
});

// snippet Scale
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Knot} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {createRef} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const knot = createRef<Knot>();

  view.add(
    <Spline lineWidth={6} stroke={'lightseagreen'}>
      <Knot position={[-100, 30]} />
      <Knot ref={knot} position={[0, -50]} startHandle={[-70, 0]} />
      <Knot position={[100, 30]} />
    </Spline>,
  );

  yield* knot().scale(3, 2).to(0.2, 2).to(1, 1);
});
```

### Animating objects along a spline

Splines can be useful to model the path that an object should follow. You can
use the `getPointAtPercentage` method to achieve this.

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Spline, Rect} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {createRef, createSignal} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const spline = createRef<Spline>();
  const progress = createSignal(0);

  view.add(
    <>
      <Spline
        ref={spline}
        lineWidth={6}
        stroke={'lightgray'}
        points={[
          [-300, 0],
          [-150, -100],
          [150, 100],
          [300, 0],
        ]}
      />
      <Rect
        size={26}
        fill={'lightseagreen'}
        position={() => spline().getPointAtPercentage(progress()).position}
        rotation={() =>
          spline().getPointAtPercentage(progress()).tangent.degrees
        }
      />,
    </>,
  );

  yield* progress(1, 2).to(0, 2);
});
```

The `getPointAtPercentage` method returns a [`CurvePoint`][curve-point] object
which contains the position of the point that sits at the given percentage along
the spline's arclength as well as the point's tangent vector.
