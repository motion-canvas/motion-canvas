# CodeBlock

<AnimationPlayer banner name="code-block" />

The `CodeBlock` component is used to present syntax highlighted code. It can
automatically highlight many common languages. That code can then be modified in
place to present changes to the viewer. Modified code will animate from the
prior code to the new code by removing old code, translating the remaining code,
and inserting new code. You may also "select" code in order to call attention to
important snippets.

## Using the component

To display code, set the `code` and `language` property.

```ts
import {CodeBlock} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components/CodeBlock';

yield view.add(
  <CodeBlock language="c#" code={`Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")`} />,
);
```

You can find a list of available languages in the [Starry Night][languages]
repositoryâ€”the library used for syntax highlighting. The default language is
`tsx`, the language of Motion Canvas, which we will use for the rest of this
guide.

Note that unlike most components, you must `yield` any call to `add` which
includes a `CodeBlock`. This prompts Motion Canvas to prepare the syntax
highlighter.

```tsx
yield view.add(<CodeBlock />);
```

### Indentation

For convenience, the indentation of code will be automatically adjust whenever
the code starts with a new line.

```tsx
import {CodeBlock} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components/CodeBlock';

yield view.add(
  // note that the ` bracket is followed by a new line
  <CodeBlock
    code={`
      console.log('Hello World!')
        // more indented
      // less indented`}
  />,
);
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
console.log('Hello World!');
  // more indented
// less indented
```

The indentation is then set by the least indented code.

```tsx
import {CodeBlock} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components/CodeBlock';

yield view.add(
  // note that the ` bracket is followed by a new line
  <CodeBlock
    code={`
      console.log('Hello World!')
    // less indented
      // more indented`}
  />,
);
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
  console.log('Hello World!');
// less indented
  // more indented
```

### Selection

Code may be "selected" to call attention to it. The default behavior is to
desaturate any unselected text.

A selection can be made using the `selection` property when the `CodeBlock` is
first created. Selections are specified using two `[line, position]` arrays,
where `line` and `position` are zero indexed, and `position` is an insert
position between characters. So `[[0, 5], [1, 2]]` will select the sixth
character on the first line through to the second character on the second line.

The following code will select `myBool` out of the code snippet.

```tsx
yield view.add(
  <CodeBlock
    code={`var myBool;`}
    selection={[
      [0, 4],
      [0, 10],
    ]}
  />,
);
```

It is often better, however, to use one of the three provided utility functions
for selection. Though they all return a two by two array of numbers, they can be
more descriptive than an array literal.

The first and most commonly used is the `range` function. `range(0, 4, 0, 10)`
is equivalent to `[[0, 4], [0, 10]]`, making `range` a direct substitute for an
array literal.

The second is the `word` function, which creates a range on a single line using
a position and a length. So `word(2, 4, 6)` will make a selection on the third
line, starting at the fifth character, and selecting a total of six characters.

Finally, you can use the `lines` function to select whole lines of code.

```tsx
import {CodeBlock, lines} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components/CodeBlock';

const codeRef = createRef();
yield view.add(
  <CodeBlock
    ref={codeRef}
    code={`
      // first line
      // second line
      // third line`}
  />,
);

// second line only
yield * codeRef().selection(lines(1), 1);
// second and third line (line 1 to line 2)
yield * codeRef().selection(lines(1, 2), 1);
```

To remove a selection, the value of `.selection()` signal can be set to its
[`DEFAULT`][signal-default], i.e. "all selected". For example:

```ts
import {DEFAULT} from '@motion-canvas/core';

// highlight lines 1 and 2
yield * codeRef().selection(lines(1, 2), 1);

// highlight all lines
yield * codeRef().selection(DEFAULT, 1);
```

Alternatively, the selected range can be set from `[0, 0]` to
`[Infinity, Infinity]` to select all text. This is most easily performed by
setting the selection to `lines(0, Infinity)`.

### Animating code

You may insert, remove, or edit the displayed code, any of which will animate
the code to its new state. All of these changes are performed with the `edit`
method on a `CodeBlock` instance.

To insert code, start by using `createRef` to store your `CodeBlock` instance
for future edits. Then call `edit` with an embedded `insert` call to add the new
code.

```tsx
import {CodeBlock, insert} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components/CodeBlock';
import {createRef} from '@motion-canvas/core';

const codeRef = createRef<CodeBlock>();

yield view.add(<CodeBlock ref={codeRef} code={`var myBool;`} />);

// duration of 1.2 seconds
yield * codeRef().edit(1.2)`var myBool${insert(' = true')};`;
```

```tsx
var myBool;
// will animate to
var myBool = true;
```

Removing code is similar, only with the provided code being removed during the
animation.

```tsx
import {CodeBlock, remove} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components/CodeBlock';

yield view.add(<CodeBlock ref={codeRef} code={`var myBool = true;`} />);

yield * codeRef().edit(1.2)`var myBool${remove(' = true')};`;
```

```tsx
var myBool = true;
// will animate to
var myBool;
```

Finally, replacing code combines removal and insertion into one call.

```tsx
yield view.add(<CodeBlock ref={codeRef} code={`var myBool = true;`} />);

yield * codeRef().edit(1.2)`var myBool = ${edit('true', 'false')};`;
```

```tsx
var myBool = true;
// will animate to
var myBool = false;
```

Editing code will update your selection to highlight the changes. If you would
like to retain your selection through an animation, use `edit(duration, false)`.

```tsx
yield view.add(<CodeBlock ref={codeRef} code={`var myBool;`} />);

// note the second argument to edit
yield * codeRef().edit(1.2, false)`var myBool${insert(' = true')};`;
```

You may apply multiple edits to a code block over the course of a video, each
modifying the prior code to a new state.

```tsx
yield view.add(<CodeBlock ref={codeRef} code={`var myBool;`} />);

yield * codeRef().edit(1.2)`var myBool${insert(' = true')};`;
yield * waitFor(1);
yield * codeRef().edit(1.2)`var myBool = ${edit('true', 'false')};`;
yield * waitFor(1);
yield * codeRef().edit(1.2)`var myBool${remove(' = false')};`;
```

The proceeding code will animate through

```tsx
var myBool;
var myBool = true;
var myBool = false;
var myBool;
```

You can also apply multiple changes to a code block in one `edit`, such that all
changes are applied simultaneously.

```tsx
yield view.add(<CodeBlock ref={codeRef} code={`var myBool;`} />);

yield *
  codeRef().edit(1.2)`${edit('var', 'const')} myBool${insert(' = true')};`;
```

```tsx
var myBool;
// will animate to
const myBool = true;
```
