## A note on tweening LaTeX

Because we use a canvas renderer, we're rendering the LaTeX to an image instead
of using a full graphics backend to render the TeX. This means that for all
intents and purposes, LaTeX should be treated as if it were an image rather than
more flexible TeX rendering like you may see in other software.

In other words, opacity, position, size, etc. should be fine to tween, but we do
not recommend tweening the `tex` signal.
