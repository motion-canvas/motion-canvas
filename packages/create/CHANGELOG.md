### BREAKING CHANGES

- remove legacy package
- change to import paths

See
[the migration guide](https://motion-canvas.github.io/guides/migration/12.0.0)
for more info.

- change the way scenes are imported

Scene files no longer need to follow the pattern: `[name].scene.tsx`. When
importing scenes in the project file, a dedicated `?scene` query param should be
used:

```ts
import example from './scenes/example?scene';

export default new Project({
  name: 'project',
  scenes: [example],
});
```
